# HelpBrew

HelpBrew is a collaborative tool where a user can interact with other like minded individuals with three different kinds of services. The first is 'Skill', where a user will request or give a short tutorial of coaching session with a particular skill that they are interested in. Secondly, a user may use 'Giveaways' to give or recieve tangible materials that may aid in their learning like books, videos, software and the like. Last but not least is 'Monetary Support' where users can give or recieve information on scholarships, grants and funds and even directly request donations.
