# HelpBrew

Spring + React application.

**IMPORTANT!** WHEN YOU CODE, MAKE SURE TO COMMIT OFTEN

### Posts & Comments

The functionalities are:

- Create a post
- Delete a post
- View all posts
- Write a comment on a post
- Delete a comment on a post
- View all comments on a post

### Who posted/commented

So you are be able to login and make a post and make a comment. The problem is that posts and
comments don't seem to belong to any user. Since we do not want to suppress free speech, each comment and post
should only be deletable by the user who posted it. Also, for us to differentiate between posters and commenters we
attach a username and email to each post and each comment. al

- In a post, we show the email of the person who posted it.
- In a comment, we show the email of the person who made it.
- only the person who is the creator of a post/comment can delete it.

### Direct Messaging

It is nice that we can communicate with people in our application but sometimes we might not want to communicate with
absolutely everyone. Wouldn't it be even nicer to be able to speak with someone in private so that you don't bother
everyone else with your messages?


### Extra features


* Images/file attachments: Users can optionally attach images or files when they post/comment.
* Like/Dislikes.
