                    <p> Protecting children, young people and vulnerable adults from harm is central to achieving our mission of providing a platform for learning opportunities.

At HelpBrew we are committed to ensuring the experience of our platform is one that is free from any form of abuse or exploitation. Everyone who comes into contact with any person associated with HelpBrew should at all times feel respected and safeguarded.

To enforce this, HelpBrew's safeguarding policy has a range of preventative measures and systems to prevent any form of abuse, and clear procedures for disciplinary action in the event this policy is breached.
